## Development Notes

### Frontend

- **Forms and Validation**: Formik and Zod ensure robust input validation for sign-up and sign-in forms.
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query manages API calls with caching for performance.
- **Real-Time Chats**: WebSocket connections are established for each companion chat.
- **Theming**: `next-themes` enables seamless light/dark mode switching.
- **Animations**: Framer Motion adds smooth transitions.
- **Responsive Design**: The navbar includes a mobile menu for accessibility on smaller screens.

### Backend

- **Security**: Middleware ensures secure API and WebSocket interactions.
- **Testing**: Jest unit tests cover all services, ensuring reliability.
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis-based rate limiting protects the API from abuse.
- **Logging**: Custom logging with `oplog` for debugging and monitoring.

## Challenges

### Limitations

- **Gemini AI Live Session Limits**: The current setup with Gemini AI Live allows only 5 concurrent sessions at a time. This limitation can cause a fallback for many users during peak usage, leading to potential delays or unavailability of AI responses for some users.
- **Predefined Companions Only**: Users are restricted to interacting with the 5 predefined AI companions (EchoBuddy, Chef EchoBite, Dr. EchoCare, EchoFit, EchoMind). There is no option for users to create or customize their own companions, which limits personalization.

### Things We Can Do Further

- **Scalable AI Service**: Build a custom AI service or integrate with a more scalable AI provider that can handle a large number of concurrent users, eliminating the session limitation imposed by Gemini AI Live.
- **Custom Companion Creation**: Introduce a feature where users can create personalized AI companions by defining their own system prompts, companion codes, and dedicated spaces. This would enhance user engagement by allowing tailored interactions.
- **Premium Features**: Implement a premium subscription model that offers additional benefits, such as access to more companions, priority AI session slots, custom companion creation, and enhanced chat features (e.g., voice chat, advanced emoji sets).

### Challenges Faced During Building

- **WebSocket Integration**: Setting up real-time WebSocket communication was challenging, particularly ensuring secure JWT-based authorization for WebSocket connections. We faced issues with maintaining persistent connections on Railway.app due to their 30-second timeout on `*.up.railway.app` domains, requiring us to recommend custom domains for production.
- **Rate Limiting with Redis**: Implementing the sliding window algorithm for rate limiting using Redis-Cloud was complex. Configuring Redis with proper TLS settings and ensuring it worked seamlessly with the Express middleware required significant debugging and testing.
- **Gemini AI Live Integration**: Integrating Gemini AI Live for real-time AI responses posed challenges due to its session limits and occasional latency. We had to implement fallback mechanisms and error handling to manage scenarios where the session limit was reached.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a fully responsive design across devices was challenging, especially with the chat interface‚Äôs sidebar and mobile menu. We had to carefully design the layout using Tailwind CSS and test extensively to ensure usability on smaller screens.
- **Chat Persistence and Context Syncing**: Synchronizing chat context across sessions while maintaining performance was difficult. Storing and retrieving chat history from MongoDB in real-time required optimization to avoid latency, especially during high user activity.
